ALX First Listings — Developer #2 Specification
🔄 simplification (newest first)
●	Escrow model added: Wallet signal replaced with USDC escrow at bid commit. Bids lock funds; refunds/top-ups on edit; release on cancel or loss. Simplifies settlement and ensures real bids.

●	Winner reveal: Only the winning bid is revealed publicly; all others remain sealed. ALX host can see bids, but users cannot.

●	Bid editing: Allowed up or down, once per hour, respecting reserve and cap. Escrow balance adjusts automatically.

●	Cancel: Users may cancel anytime before settlement; escrow is refunded immediately.

●	Whitelist: External provider (Merkle or signature) still required at commit and optionally re-checked before transfer. Dev 2 integrates only via interface.

●	Reserve: Reserve is public at IPO creation (floor). Admin sets OTC price; contract enforces cap = OTC × 1.30. UI shows both.

●	Auction type: Sealed-bid, second-price. Winner pays max(second-highest bid, reserve).

●	Tie-break: If multiple bids at top price: sort by ALX Score, take top 20, VRF-shuffle, attempt in order until settlement succeeds.

●	Events: Expanded to log escrow flows, edits, cancels, settlement outcomes.

●	Admin dApp: Clarified single-page admin UI (Safe multisig wallets only). Shows UTC times; UI also displays EDT with DST.

________________________________________
⚙️ Auction Rules (English)
1.	Auction type: Sealed-bid, second-price.

○	Bidders place hidden bids; only the final winner is revealed.

○	Winner pays the second-highest bid or the reserve, whichever is greater.

2.	Reserve & Cap:

○	Reserve = public floor set by Admin.

○	Cap = 130% of OTC reference price.

○	All bids must fall between reserve and cap.

3.	Escrow:

○	On commit, full bid amount is escrowed.

○	If bidder edits upward → must deposit more.

○	If edits downward → refund the difference.

○	If canceled or lost → full refund to user’s balance.

○	If winner → settlement pulls escrow at clearing price, refunds surplus.

4.	Settlement:

○	Auto-runs after close.

○	Sorts bids high → low; applies second-price rule.

○	If tie at top price → rank by ALX Score → take top 20 → VRF-shuffle → attempt each in order.

○	If all top tier fail, move to next tier.

○	If no bids ≥ reserve, IPO fails; NFT remains in custody.

✅ One-Line Why for Escrow
Escrow ensures bids are real, simplifies settlement, and lets non-winning funds roll forward as buying power for other First Listings.

CONTINUED MORE DETAILED SPEC BELOW

ALX First Listings — Dev 2 Final Reference Spec
0) Change log (summary of what’s simplified / clarified today)
●	Escrow model: Replaced “wallet signal” with USDC escrow at bid commit. Bids lock funds; edits top-up or refund the delta; cancel refunds; losers’ funds become available balance for other First Listings.

●	Sealed from users, host-visible: Other bidders cannot see amounts while live. ALX (host) can see bids via backend and contract state. Only the winning bid is revealed publicly at the end.

●	Public reserve, market value cap: Admin publishes reserve (floor) and OTC market value. Contract enforces cap = market × 1.30.

●	Auction type fixed: Sealed-bid, second-price. Winner pays max(second-highest, reserve).

●	Tie-break finalization: If a tie at top price → rank by ALX Score (desc), take top 20, VRF-shuffle, attempt settlement in that order; if all fail, go to the next price tier.

●	Edits & cancel: Edit once per hour per IPO; cancel anytime pre-settle. Escrow adjusts automatically.

●	Timing & T+21: On-chain times in UTC; UI shows UTC + EDT with DST. First Listings are run as T+21 events so settlement occurs within 21 days while asset onboarding, custody verification, and tokenization are completed (capital-efficient).

●	Admin dApp & events: Clear admin UI; rich events for auto-listing in the UI and for external indexers.

One-line why escrow: Escrow ensures bids are real, simplifies settlement, and lets non-winning funds roll forward as buying power for other First Listings.
________________________________________
1) Concept & goals
●	What First Listings are: Daily IPO-like primary offerings that bring custody-verified cultural assets onto the ALX exchange with on-chain transparency.

●	User promise: Simple, fair participation; reserve disclosed; no public bid leaks during the auction; only the winner is revealed.

●	Platform promise: Capital-efficient T+21 settlement using cleared funds; pricing aligned to real-world markets with a +30% cap; deterministic and auditable settlement.

________________________________________
2) Policy summary (english)
●	Auction type: Sealed bid, second price.

●	Reserve: Public floor per asset; bids must be ≥ reserve.

●	Cap: 130% of published market value (OTC). Bids must be ≤ cap.

●	Sealed model: Other users cannot see bids while live; ALX can see through backend/contract; only the winner is revealed at the end.

●	Edits & cancel: Edit up/down (1× per hour) within reserve–cap; cancel anytime pre-settle.

●	Escrowed funds: Full bid is escrowed at commit; edits top-up/refund delta; cancel refunds; losers’ funds become available balance; winner’s escrow is used at clearing price and any surplus is refunded.

●	Tie-break: If multiple at the top price → rank by ALX Score -> take top 20 -> VRF shuffle -> try in order.

●	T+21: Settlement occurs within 21 days while the asset is onboarded, custody verified, and tokenized.

________________________________________
3) Network & environment
●	Chain: Base (beta on Base Sepolia, then Base mainnet).

●	Admin wallet: ALX Safe (multisig).

●	Currency: USDC on Base.

●	NFT: Single ALX ERC-721 collection (one contract, many tokenIds).

________________________________________
4) Roles & external systems (Dev 2 consumes, does not build)
●	Whitelist provider: Merkle or EIP-712 signature allowlist. Dev 2 only calls isAllowed(...).

●	ALX Score: Attestation (EIP-712) verifier or on-chain registry. Dev 2 verifies/reads score at reveal; uses only for tie-break.

●	Randomness: Chainlink VRF for tie pool shuffling.

●	Automation: Chainlink Automation or Gelato to call settlement permissionlessly right after close.

●	Indexing: The Graph subgraph (or equivalent) for UI and external feeds.

Guards enforced on-chain
●	Always: reserve ≤ amount ≤ cap.

●	Edit cooldown: 1 hour per IPO.

●	Whitelist: required at commit and edit.

●	RevealWinner: verifies commit hash, range, and ALX Score proof/registry.

________________________________________
9) Escrow mechanics (how money moves)
Commit
●	User calls commitBid with escrowAmount (their sealed bid).

●	Contract pulls USDC (transferFrom) and locks it in bids[ipoId][user].escrowed.

●	commitHash is stored; no amounts are emitted in events.

Edit (once per hour)
●	New sealed commitHash + newEscrowAmount.

●	If higher → pull delta into escrow; if lower → refund delta to user (or to their available balance in your ledger, if you prefer pooled UX).

●	Prior commit marked Superseded; new record set as Committed.

Cancel
●	Refund full escrowed; set status Canceled.

Settlement
●	Winner’s clearing price debited from their escrow and sent to the seller; any surplus escrow is refunded to user.

●	Losers’ escrow is released back as available balance (for re-bids); optionally expose withdraw() for off-ramp.

Note on secrecy: Escrow transfers happen, but do not log amounts in events; typical users won’t see bid sizes in the UI. If deeper privacy is required later, we can migrate to pooled user balances + per-IPO locks without emitting per-bid values.
________________________________________
10) Winner selection and settlement algorithm
1.	Close guard: after revealEnd, call settleWithRandomness(ipoId, randomSeed) (anyone or via Automation).

2.	Collect valid bids: status is Revealed for the winner (others remain sealed to public); for ordering we rely on host visibility plus escrowed amounts in state.

3.	Sort by price tiers: high → low.

4.	Second-price rule: clearingPrice = max(secondHighest, reserve).

5.	Tie at top price:

○	Rank by ALX Score (desc), then FIFO commitTime (asc).

○	Take top 20 and VRF-shuffle order.

○	Attempt settlement in that order. If a wallet fails (unexpected allowance changes etc.), emit Defaulted(...) and try next.

6.	Fallback: If all top tier fail, go to next lower tier and repeat.

7.	Outcomes:

○	Sold → emit WinnerFinal + AuctionOutcome.

○	FailedReserve → emit FailedReserve + AuctionOutcome with sold=false.

Why this balance: It rewards activity via the score, prevents the same wallet from always winning, and uses VRF to keep selection fair.
________________________________________
11) Interfaces Dev 2 integrates (not owning)
●	Whitelist: IWhitelistProvider.isAllowed(ipoId, wallet, proofOrSig)

●	Score:

○	Attestation path: IScoreVerifier.verifyScore(wallet, score, epochId, sig) at revealWinner

○	Registry path: IScoreRegistry.scoreOf(wallet)

Dev 2 only reads/verifies these. Another dev/team owns signing, roots, epochs.
________________________________________
12) Admin dApp and public UI
Admin (First Listings subdomain)
●	Create Listing form: collection, tokenId, seller, USDC, market value (OTC), reserve, auto-computed cap (MV × 1.30), commit/reveal/close times (UTC).

●	Publish: calls createIPO from ALX Safe.

●	Dashboard: show status, timers (UTC + EDT with DST), commit/reveal counts.

●	Auto-add: UI listens for IPOCreated and updates list immediately.

Public pages (same subdomain)
●	Listings page: filter/sort upcoming and live First Listings; show market value, reserve, cap rule, countdowns (UTC + EDT).

●	Detail page: place / edit / cancel bid; show Available Balance; show auto list preference for the exchange (default 5%, menu 5/10/15/20, toggle off).

●	Visibility: never show others’ bids or amounts while live; after settlement show winner address and clearing price.

________________________________________
13) Gas, approvals, and meta-tx
●	Meta-tx (ERC-2771 MinimalForwarder): ALX relayer can submit user txs so UX is smooth.

●	Escrow transfer: use permit2 (or EIP-2612 if supported) to avoid an extra approve step; fallback to standard approve + commitBid.

●	Owner of gas: ALX pays via relayer where feasible; users pay their USDC transfer in the worst case.

________________________________________
14) Security & audit notes
●	Access control: only ALX Safe can createIPO.

●	Reentrancy guards on escrow moves and settlement.

●	Never emit per-bid amounts in events (only final winner).

●	Unit tests for all state transitions; fuzz on price tiers and VRF ordering.

●	Pause / kill switch owned by Safe (emergency).

________________________________________
15) Test plan (must-pass)
●	Create IPO: reserve/cap/times validation.

●	Commit: whitelist gate; escrow pull; event without amount.

●	Edit: 1-hour cooldown; top-up/down delta; no amount in event.

●	Cancel: refund full escrow; cannot settle canceled bids.

●	Range guards: reserve ≤ amount ≤ cap everywhere.

●	Tie-breaks: score ordering, FIFO, top-20 VRF shuffle reproducible.

●	Second-price calc: multiple tiers and single-bid case (pay reserve).

●	Settlement: winner pays seller; surplus refunded; losers released to available balance; FailedReserve path.

●	Time zones: UTC stored; UI renders EDT with DST.

19) Final checklist
●	Naming: “First Listings” everywhere (no IPO in code/UI labels).

●	Public reserve and cap logic on chain; UI mirrors and validates.

●	Escrow at commit; edit top-up/refund; cancel refund; loser release.

●	Only winner revealed publicly; final price emitted.

●	Tie-break: Score → top 20 → VRF.

●	Permissionless settlement after close; rich events.

●	UTC on chain; UI shows UTC + EDT with DST.

●	No listing fee at First Listing; exchange fees apply later on secondary trades (not in this contract).

________________________________________
✅ What I verified as complete and consistent
●	Naming: Everything now uses First Listings (IPO references are eliminated except when described as “IPO-like”).

●	Auction Type: Sealed-bid, commit–reveal, second-price → locked.

●	Funds Handling: Wallet signal fully replaced by escrow; edits/cancels refund/top-up delta.

●	Visibility: Sealed from users (no competitor visibility), host-visible, only winner revealed.

●	Reserve/Cap: Reserve public, cap = OTC × 1.30, enforced on chain.

●	T+21: Defined as settlement within 21 days for onboarding, custody verification, and tokenization.
